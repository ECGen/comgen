# Lichen Network Study

- This project uses Drake, a workflow system designed for R.
- To access the project, run `make.R`, which will load the necessary
  libraries and execute modeling and analyses for the project.
- Details of the analyses see `results/report_lcn.pdf`
- To see the workflow, run `vis_drake_graph(drake_config(plan))` or
  see R/plan.R for more details.
- If you want to run further analyses, you can access data objects
  from the workflow by using the drake function `loadd`.
