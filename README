# Lichen Network Study

- This project uses Drake, a workflow system designed for R.  
- To access the project, run `make.R`, which will load the necessary
  libraries and execute modeling and analyses for the project.
- Details of the data and analyses can be found in R/plan.R.
- To see the workflow, run `vis_drake_graph(drake_config(plan))`.
- If you want to run further analyses, you can access data objects
  from the workflow by using the drake function `loadd`.
