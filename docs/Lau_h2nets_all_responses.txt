ABSTRACT
Biological evolution occurs in ecosystems whereby natural selection defines the structure of ecological networks. Therefore, elucidating the genetic basis to ecological
network structure is fundamental to understanding evolution. Although previous work
has demonstrated that genetic variation can influence food webs and trophic chains,
we are unaware of a study that quantified the contribution of phenotypic variation
to heritable variation in network structure. To examine this, in a 20+ year common
garden we observed epiphytic lichen associated with narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus
angustifolia), a riparian ecosystem foundation species. We constructed and conducted
genetic analyses of signed, weighted, directed lichen interaction networks. We found
three primary results. First, genotype identity significantly predicted lichen network
similarity; i.e., replicates of the same genotype supported more similar lichen networks
than different genotypes. Second, broad sense heritability estimates showed that plant
genotype explained network similarity (H 2 = 0.41), degree (H 2 = 0.32) and centralization (H 2 = 0.33). Third, of several tree phenotypic traits examined, bark roughness was
both heritable (H 2 = 0.32) and significantly correlated with lichen network similarity
(R2 = 0.26). These results support a mechanistic, genetic pathway from variation in
a heritable tree trait to ecological network structure and demonstrate that evolution
can act at the community level to influence not only abundances of organisms but also
interactions at the scale of entire networks. Given that network structure can influence
system-wide stability and resilience, our findings have important implications for how
evolution acts in ecosystems.

INTRODUCTION
Evolution occurs in the context of complex ecological networks. Community genetics
studies have shown that genetic variation in foundation species, which have large effects
on ecosystems by modulating and stabilizing local conditions (Ellison et al., 2005),
plays a significant role in defining distinct communities of interacting organisms: such
as, endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, and soil microbes (Busby et al., 2015;
Barbour et al., 2009; Lamit et al., 2015a). Multiple studies have now demonstrated that
genetic variation influences numerous functional traits (e.g., phytochemical, phenological, morphological) that in combination result in a multivariate functional trait phenotype
(Holeski et al., 2012) in which individual plant genotypes support different communities
and ecosystem processes (Bailey et al., 2009; Whitham et al., 2012). Recently, the
importance of genetic variation in structuring ecological systems was reviewed, and
not only were many instances of strong genetic effects found in many ecosystems but
the effect of intraspecific variation was at times greater than inter-specific variation
(Des Roches et al., 2018). There is now evidence to support that selection, acting on
this heritable variation, tends to occur among groups of species (Wade, 2007) and that
genetic variation and phylogenetic relatedness contribute to variation in community
assembly (Crutsinger, 2016) and species interactions (Whitham et al., 2006; Bailey et al.,
2009; Moya-Laraño, 2011), which shape the structure of ecological interaction networks
(Rezende et al., 2007; Guimarães et al., 2007; Gómez et al., 2009).
Empirical and theoretical work in network ecology and evolutionary biology point
to the need for examinations of the genetic basis of ecological network structure. Analyses of ecological networks have demonstrated that indirect effects can lead to selforganization, producing sign-changing, amplifying and/or dampening effects (Newman,
2006; Sole and Bascompte, 2006), and other studies have demonstrated that indirect
effects of interactions among species can lead to network structures that amplify or
dampen the effects of selection, such as the formation of star-like structures in which
there is a “central” species or group of species that interact with other, peripheral species,
can amplify selection events (Lieberman et al., 2005). Also, work by Toju et al. (2014,
2016, 2017) observed consistent patterns of centralized interactions of species modules
(i.e., groups of species that interact more strongly within their group than with other
species) focused around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other words, a small
number of plant and fungal symbionts tended to have disproportionate numbers of
interactions with other species and likely are the drivers in determining community
assembly, structure and dynamics. Interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGE) theory
(sensu Shuster et al. (2006)) in evolutionary biology also point to the importance of
studying the genetics of interaction network structure. Genetic based differences in
network structure among individuals can be acted upon by natural selection when there
are fitness consequences of different networks of IIGEs, leading to community evolution
per Whitham et al. (2020) and, by extension, network evolution. For example, although
the analysis was of abundances rather than interaction networks, Gehring et al. (2014,
2017) found that the mycorrhizal communities on the roots of drought tolerant and intolerant trees are dominated by different orders of ectomycorrhizal fungal mutualists that
also differ in the benefits they provide that enhance tree performance. Because drought
tolerant genotypes are three times more likely to survive record droughts, selection acts

both on the tree and its fungal community and with increased drought the community
phenotype has changed over time. Also, in an antagonistic interaction context, Busby
et al. (2015) found that with the addition of a damaging leaf pathogen to cottonwoods
in a common garden, the impacts of these strong interactors results in a different and
diminished community of arthropods relative to control trees. Thus, selection acting on
the tree may alter the network structure of associated communities in which different
networks of communities are most likely to survive pathogen outbreaks. Regardless of
whether the IIGE is unilateral (i.e., tree affects the community) or reciprocal (i.e., the
community also affects the relative fitness of the tree), selection on tree, community or
both can change network structure (Whitham et al., 2020) and thereby alter community
dynamics.
In this context, the “genetic similarity rule” of community genetics provides a
useful framework we can apply to interaction networks at the nexus of ecological
and evolutionary dynamics. In a study combining experimental common gardens and
landscape-scale observations of interactions between Populus spp. (cottonwoods) and
arthropods, Bangert et al. (2006) observed that individual genotypes that are more genetically similar will tend to have similar phytochemical traits and thus tend to have similar
interactions with other species than individuals that are less similar. Although this is
likely to have consequences for interactions and network structure, studies in the network
ecology literature generally do not include a genetic component (Lau et al., 2017) and
community genetics studies have primarily focused on community composition in terms
of the abundance of species (Des Roches et al., 2018). Some studies have examined the
effects of genetic variation on trophic chains in plant-associated communities (including
Populus, Solidago, Oenothera, Salix) (Bailey et al., 2005; Johnson, 2008; Smith et al.,
2011, 2015; Barbour et al., 2016) and generally found that increasing genotypic diversity
leads to increased trophic complexity. Only two other studies, that we are aware of,
have explicitly examined the effect of genotypic variation on the structure of interaction
networks between tree individuals and associated herbivores (Lau et al., 2016a; Keith
et al., 2017) and both found that genotypic diversity generates increased network modularity (i.e., compartmentalization). However, both of these studies were examining
networks at the scale of forest stands, rather than networks associated with individual
trees; therefore, neither was able to observe replicated networks in order to statistically
test for genetic effects on network structure and quantify the genetic component (i.e.,
heritable variation) in network structure.
Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a foundation tree species determines
the structure of a network of interactions among a community of tree associated lichens.
Using a long-term (20+ years), common garden experiment with clonally replicated
Populus angustifolia individuals of known genetic identity (Martinsen et al., 2001).
We focused on a community of 9 epiphytic lichen species, as previous research has
demonstrated significant compositional responses of epiphytes to genotypic variation
(Winfree et al., 2011; Zytynska et al., 2011). Applying a probability-theory based
network modeling approach (Araújo et al., 2011), we constructed a set of interaction
network models for the lichens associated with individual trees. Using these models,
we then examined the genetic basis of the structure of these ecological networks via
several network metrics that measure different aspects of network structure at the scale
of individual species (i.e., nodes) or the entire network observed on each tree genotype.

Given the potential importance of focal or “central” nodes (e.g., species) for determining
network dynamics (Lieberman et al., 2005), we focused on network metrics that measure
centrality for individual species and centralization for whole networks. Both of these
metrics measure how much a species is connected in the network relative to other
species. As there is a preponderance of evidence that in natural systems evolution
occurs in communities comprised of networks of interacting species (Lau et al., 2016a;
Keith et al., 2017; Thompson, 2013; Bascompte et al., 2006), we set out to test two
hypotheses. First, per the community similarity rule (Bangert et al., 2006) and IIGE
theory (Whitham et al., 2020), we hypothesize that trees of the same genotype (i.e.,
clones) will support more similar lichen interaction networks relative to less related
genotypes. In other words, epiphytic lichen network structure is heritable, which
can be calculated via comparisons of within and among group variation in network
structure. Second, heritability of lichen network structure is the result of underlying
phenotypic covariation in tree traits important to interactions between trees and lichens
and among lichens. Evidence that such trait covariance generates variation in interactions
among community members provides an intermediate genetics-based mechanism for
the underlying factors determining lichen distribution and abundance. In combination,
evaluating these two hypotheses is fundamental to understanding variation and dynamics
of network structure and evolution.

Study System
The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a cottonwood
(Populus spp.) dominated riparian ecosystem. Although two native species, Populus
angustifolia (James) and Populus fremontii (S. Watson), occur here and are known
to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation back-crosses of P. angustifolia were
sampled. Bark lichens have been intensively sampled in this system and provide an ideal
community in which to observe and model interaction networks, as their sessile nature
permits accurate identification of individuals and their highly localized, direct contact
interactions and slow population turnover rates facilitate the assessment of interactions
among lichen species on individual trees (Lamit et al., 2015b).
A long-term, common garden experiment was used to isolate the effect of tree genotype from the effect of the localized microenvironment associated with each individual
and spatial autocorrelation. Established in 1992, asexually propagated clones of genotyped P. angustifolia individuals were obtained from wild collections and planted in
fully randomized design at the Ogden Nature Center, Ogden, UT. From the population
of established individuals in the common garden, we chose a total of ten genotypes,
replicated between 3 and 8 times each, for sampling. We selected tree genotypes that
generally had lichen present in order to permit the construction of interaction networks.
Bark Lichen and Trait Observations
On each tree, presence or absence of each lichen species was assessed in 50 total 1 cm2
cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Given the small size and sessile nature of lichens,
we were able to rapidly assess lichen interactions by quantifying thalli in close contact.
Sampling was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk to maximize the abundance of

lichen and control for the effect of trunk aspect. Two adjacent 100 cm2 quadrats centered
at 50 cm and 95 cm from ground level were sampled (Fig 1 A and B). The observed
lichen community included (abbreviations are given for species present in study): Xg
= Xanthomendoza galericulata, Xm = X. montana, Ch = Caloplaca holocarpa, Cs =
Candelariella subdeflexa, Rg = Rinodina glauca, Lh = Lecanora hagenii, Pm = Phyciella
melanchra, Pa = Physcia adscendens, Pu = Physcia undulata. Several other species were
not observed in the present study but are known to occur in this region: Phaeophyscia
orbicularis, Phaeophyscia ciliata, Melanelia subolivacea, Meanelia elegantula.
The cell size and checkerboard sampling pattern was chosen to isolate the individuals
in each cell. In a previous survey of X. galericulata thallus size in this common garden
(Lamit et al., 2015b), we had observed a median thallus size of 0.12 ± 0.001 cm2 (1
S.E.) (Supporting Information, Fig. 1). Based on the median thallus size, we expected
thalli observed in each cell to generally be spatially independent of thalli present in other
cells but exposed to similar micro-environmental conditions created by the bark and
the location of the sampling area on an individual tree. Therefore, we were confident
in treating the cell-wise observations in quadrats as independent with respect to lichenlichen interactions. We quantified the texture of the bark in the quadrat is the percent of
1 cm2 cells with rough bark. In addition to bark roughness, we also measured several
bark chemistry traits by taking bark samples immediately adjacent to each quadrat using
the methods of Lamit et al. (2011): including, the concentration of condensed tannins,
pH and carbon and nitrogen concentrations and pH.
Lichen Network Modeling
For each tree, repeated observations of lichen were made in order to construct replicated
interaction networks for each genotype. We conducted a modified sampling procedure
originally developed by Lamit et al. (2015b) with the addition that we quantified the
presence of lichen in the 1 cm2 cells on individual trees of P. angustifolia. Unipartite
networks were generated using the conditional probabilities of each species pair, i.e., the
probability of observing one species given an observation of another species P(Si |S j ),
based on the method developed by Araújo et al. (2011). To calculate conditional
probabilities, we quantified the individual probabilities of species occurrences P(Si ) and
the joint probability of co-occurrences P(Si , S j ) using the frequencies of each species
and their co-occurrences. We were then able to calculate the conditional probabilities of
P(S ,S )
each species pair as P(Si |S j ) = P(Si j )j , based on the axioms of probability. This yielded
a matrix that could possibly be asymmetric, i.e., P(Si |S j ) does not have to be equal to
P(S j |Si ). Another important property of this matrix is that the diagonal, P(Si |Si ), was
equal to one for all species present and zero for species that were not observed in any
cell.
We then applied an analytical procedure to remove non-significant links between
species. This procedure determines if the joint probability of a species pair (i.e., P(Si , S j ))
is different from zero (Fig.
p 2). Here, a confidence interval CI95% is calculated as as
CI95% = E[Si S j ] ∗ Z95% ∗ V (Si S j ), where the expected frequency of co-occurrences
E(Si S j ) is the total number of cells surveyed (N) times the independent probabilities of
each species P(Si ) ∗ P(S j ), Z95% is the Z-score for 95% from a Z-distribution and the
expected variance of E(Si S j ) is the total number of cells times the expected probability
of Si S j and its compliment (i.e., V (Si S j ) = N ∗ E[P(Si , S j )] ∗ (1 − E[P(Si , S j )])). If

the observed number of co-occurrence falls outside of the confidence interval, the
joint probability P(Si , S j ) is determined to be equal to the product of the individual
probabilities (i.e., P(Si )Ṗ(S j )), and the conditional probability reduces to the individual
probability of that species P(Si ). Therefore, unless the co-occurrence of a species pair
falls outside the confidence interval, the probability that the observation of one species
given the other is no different than simply observing that species alone. This enables us
to remove links from a given network by re-scaling the resulting conditional probabilities
by subtracting the individual probabilities from the conditional probabilities (i.e., how
different the conditional probability is from the independent probability), which makes
any species with a non-significant conditional probability zero.
The resulting matrix (D = Di j ) can be interpreted as one species’ impact on another
with zero being no effect and values less than or greater than zero being negative and
positive effects, respectively. We will refer to D as a signed, weighted interaction
matrix. As such, D has the properties that it can be asymmetric (i.e., Di j does not
necessarily equal D ji ) and it scales between -1 and 1, and, therefore, does not have the
mathematical properties of a probabilistic network (Poisot et al., 2016). Also, as the
method does not track individuals within species and interactions such as competitive
exclusion or facilitation within species would result in the same species being observed.
Therefore, the results of intra-specific interactions always results in the same species
being observed and a resulting Dii = 0. In the context of these networks, asymmetry and
positive/negative valued connections are distinct quantities. In-coming and out-going
connections can be interpreted as “influenced by” and “influenced”, respectively; while
positive and negative should be seen as one species increasing or decreasing, respectively,
the probability of another species’ occurrence.
Analyses, Software and Data
To quantify the structural variation of lichen networks we calculated several metrics at
both the level of node and whole networks. Although there are many other metrics, for
the sake of simplicity we focus on a subset that represent the primary interesting features
of network structure (see Lau et al. (2017)). We calculated the number of interactions or
“links” in each network (degree), which provides a measure of the size of the network
(Lau et al., 2016a; Borrett and Lau, 2014). We also calculated the centralization of each
network using Freeman’s centrality, which measures the evenness of the distribution of
interactions among the species in the network, using the sna package (Butts, 2019). In
a network with a low level of centralization species have similar amount of interaction
in the network, while a network with a high level of centralization tends to have one or
small number of species that interact with other species. We used a related function to
calculate the centrality of each species (i.e., node level centrality) in each network as well.
To calculate separate metrics for positive and negative links, as the networks contained
not only positive and negative connections but also directional connections (both incoming and out-going), we calculated the same network metrics for all combinations of
these types of connections using recently developed methods for signed, weighted and
directed networks (Everett and Borgatti, 2014) using the signnet package (Schoch,
2020).
We used a combination of parametric and non-parametric, permutation based frequentist statistical analyses to test for the effects of genetic variation on lichen communities
6/23

268

and their interaction networks. To assess the effect of genotype on univariate responses,
we used additive, random effects models with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML).
We used a combination of Least Squares Regression, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
and correlation tests to quantify and test for the relationship among other variables. Bark
roughness, lichen cover and species richness were square-root transformed to meet the
assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality for these tests.
For multivariate response variables, such as lichen community composition and
network structure, we used distance based multivariate statistical approaches, including
Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) and Mantel tests. To quantify
the similarity of lichen networks among individual trees, we calculated the pairwise
Euclidean distance of the D interaction matrices among all pairs of trees. For visualization of multivariate patterns, we used Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS)
(Goslee and Urban, 2007) to produce dimensionally reduced ordinations of these multivariate responses and fitted vectors for continuous predictor variables to the ordinated
values (Oksanen et al., 2019). Using random initial configurations with a maximum of
500 iterations and a change in stress threshold of less than 10−12 . Final configurations
has the lowest stress with at most a stress level of 0.10.
For all tests where genotype was used as a predictor, we quantified the heritability
of the response variable. Because the trees in the garden were clonal replicates of each
genotype, we calculated broad-sense heritability, which is the genotypic variance divided
by the total phenotypic variance (Conner and Hartl, 2004). This can be interpreted as a
measure of the phenotypic variance due to genotypic variation.
All analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1 (R Development Core Team 2019).
Code and data for the project are openly available as a reproducible workflow using
drake (Landau, 2018), which is archived via Zenodo zenodo.com/doiXXXXXX.

In support of our first hypotheses, we found that tree genotype influenced lichen network
structure and multiple lichen network metrics were heritable. Tree genotype significantly
predicted the structural similarity of lichen networks and, overall, network-level metrics
responded significantly to tree genotype, including network degree and centralization
including both in-coming and out-going links or when separated into in-coming only
or out-going only (Table 1, Fig. 4). Metrics including only positive links also showed
a significant effect of tree genotype, including positive degree and positive in-going
centralization. Metrics calculated with negative links were not significant, including
degree (negative) and both in-coming (negative) and out-going centralization (negative).
The genetic response of network centralization was driven by variation in Caloplaca
holocarpa. Centrality varied significantly among species (F8,324 = 7.99, R2 = 0.16,
p-value < 0.0001). Caloplaca holocarpa centrality was the main species to exhibit
a significant response to tree genotype in terms of positive centrality for both the incoming (RLRT = 3.61, H 2 = 0.32, p-value = 0.0240) and out-going (RLRT = 3.13, H 2
= 0.30, p-value = 0.0327) perspectives, but not for either negative centrality metrics
in-coming (RLRT = 0, H 2 = 0, p-value = 1) or out-going (RLRT = 0, H 2 = 0, p-value =
0.4543). None of the other species’ centralities showed a genotypic response (Supporting
Information, Fig. 2) with the exception of X. montana (RLRT = 2.92, H 2 = 0.32, p-value

holocarpa and the variation in X. montana centrality was restricted to two genotypes
(Fig. 5).
In support of our second hypothesis, analysis of trait covariation revealed that genotype indirectly influenced lichen network centralization via genetically based variation in
bark roughness. The percent cover of rough bark (RLRT = 4.8526, H 2 = 0.3221, p-value

both displayed significant responses to tree genotype. None of the other bark traits, pH
(RLRT = 0.00, H 2 = 0.00, p-value = 1.0000) or carbon-nitrogen ratio (RLRT = 0.0000,
H 2 = 0.0000, p-value = 1.0000), showed a significant response to tree genotype and
none other than bark roughness was correlated with network similarity (Table 2); therefore, we focused our subsequent analyses on the indirect effect of genotype on lichen
network structure via bark roughness. We found that bark roughness was significantly
correlated with network similarity and other lichen network metrics, including negative
correlations with overall network degree (d f = 35, t = -2.13, r = -0.34, p-value = 0.04)
and centralization (d f = 35, t = -2.52, r = -0.39, p-value = 0.02). In other words, trees
with more similar levels of bark roughness tended to have lichen interaction networks
with similar structure. To quantify the genetic bases of this effect of bark roughness on
network structure, we used the residual values from regressions of network degree and
centralization in tests of the effect of tree genotype and found no significant effect of tree
genotype for either degree (RLRT = 0.00, H 2 = 0.00, p-value = 1.0000) or centralization
(RLRT = 0.00, H 2 = 0.00, p-value = 1.0000), suggesting that the observed relationship
between bark roughness and lichen network structure was largely genetically based
(Fig. 6).

similar on trees of the same genotype. Generally, this genetic effect was manifested
in positive interactions and largely driven by C. holocarpa. Second, the genetically
based trait, bark roughness, was observed to affect network variation, largely via shifts
in positive in-coming and out-going interactions. Chemistry traits, whether genetically
based, such as tannin concentration, or not, were not significantly correlated with lichen
network structure. Bark roughness has been demonstrated previously to be under strong
genetic control (Bdeir et al., 2017), and bark roughness has also been shown to be an
important tree trait influencing bark lichens (Lamit et al., 2015b); however this is the first
demonstration of a link from genetics to lichen network structure. As such these results
have important implications for the potential influence of genetically based variation in
ecosystems with networks of interacting species.
Implications of Ecological Network Heritability
Significant heritability of lichen interaction network structure is in line with the genetic
similarity rule, networks observed on trees of the same genotype tended to be structurally
similar. Although previous studies have examined aspects of networks, such as trophic
complexity (Barbour et al., 2016) and forest stand-level interaction network structure
(Lau et al., 2016b; Keith et al., 2017), this is the first study that we are aware of to
examine the heritability of network structure with replicated networks at the genotype
scale. Previous work in the evolution of ecological networks have primarily focused on
macro-evolutionary dynamics (Rezende et al., 2007; Weber et al., 2017; Valverde et al.,
2018; Harmon et al., 2019) or have been simulation based individual-level models that
integrate intraspecific variation to the species level (Maliet et al., 2020), even though
recent syntheses have pointed to the importance of processes operating across scales of
organization (Guimarães, 2020). There are two important functional ramifications of
genetically based variation in network structure.
First, heritability of network structure suggests that some amount of interaction
network complexity is determined and therefore could be predicted by genetic identity.
Variation in space and time create variation in ecological networks that influences evolutionary dynamics via shifts in ecological dynamics, such as population demographics
(Guimarães, 2020). Given that ecosystems are comprised of hundreds and thousands of
species, each having a multitude of interactions, the potential to find traction for making
predictions in the context of ecological, let alone evolutionary, dynamics seems daunting.
The promise of predictability lies in the presence of asymmetries in ecosystems that
contribute to the occurrence of foundation species, such as hierarchy and nestedness

created by body size differences or life-history strategies, has been widely observed
(Ellison et al., 2005). The second is that heritability (i.e., genetic determination) means
that there is structure in the spatial or temporal variation that is created by individuals of
foundation species whose traits are in part determined by underlying trait differences.
Although this variation is inherently a function of both genetic and environmental effects
(Conner and Hartl, 2004), the community and network-level effects are also a function
of the scale of the interaction (Shuster et al., 2006).
Second, even if the composition of the communities is the same among individuals
and genotypes, interactions may not be. We didn’t observe compositional differences
using the same data from which the lichen networks were derived. If we only had
our composition dataset from this study, we would have concluded no response of the
lichen community to tree genotype, even though the underlying interactions among
lichen species does vary among genotypes. As such differences in network structure
could occur without observable differences in species richness or community composition, which have been the primary focus of almost all previous community genetics
studies (Des Roches et al., 2018). Community composition of lichen has previously
been observed to be different among tree genotype in the same experimental garden
(Lamit et al., 2011, 2015b), the difference between the present study is likely a result
of differences in sampling method for lichen and the genotypes observed leading to
overall higher abundances of observed lichens to assure the possibility of observing
lichen interactions. The previous study used a visual percent cover estimation, unlike
the current study, which observed lichen at the scale of 1 cm2 cells, which could overestimate cover depending on the frequency at which actual thallus size was less than 1
cm2 , as well as both the northern and southern aspects of each tree. These differences
do not negate the findings of either study. The present study’s finding of differences in
network structure without significant compositional differences points to the importance
of quantifying how network structure changes in response to genetic variation in order to
fully understand evolutionary dynamics in complex communities. Having not observed
a compositional effect of tree genotype without measuring the network structure could
lead to the conclusion of no genetic effect on the community, even though differences
in network structure are leading to altered, local evolutionary dynamics. It is possible
that these underlying differences in interactions among lichen could lead to differences
in community composition at a future point in time via their effects on species abundances (Shuster et al., 2006); however, this is not needed for evolutionary dynamics to
play out via selection that leads to shifts in trait distributions without shifting species
abundance distributions, which is possible under stabilizing, disruptive and directional
selection (Conner and Hartl, 2004), so long as the relative abundances of each species is
imperceptibly changed. Thus, it is imperative that further community genetics research
assess or at least be aware of the potential effects of variation in interactions and not
just observe species abundances, otherwise community level genetic effects may be
underestimated, especially when cumulative interaction effects are taken into account
(Borrett et al., 2007).
Furthermore, the demonstration of the heritability of interaction networks, without
significant differences in community composition, provides clear empirical evidence
that variation in network structure points to the need to expand IIGEs to encompass
the structure of interaction networks. Although, IIGE theory provides a quantitative

framework within which to approach evolutionary theory at higher levels of biological
organization (from populations to communities and ecosystems), this theory has focused
on modeling the strong effects of foundation species (Shuster et al., 2006; Whitham
et al., 2012, 2020) and has not yet integrated developments from the ecological or
evolutionary network theory literature. Thus, it has not developed a way to examine
complex interactions among species; however, previous studies have demonstrated this
network context is likely to be important, as altering the structure of interaction networks
provides a means for genetic effects to be dampened or magnified within the system of
interacting species Smith et al. (2011); Keith et al. (2017). Although such a synthesis
necessitates a much greater effort than can be afforded in this paper, it is possible to point
to several productive pathways forward. In terms of interaction networks, foundation
species are relatively central within the system of interactions, that is their direct and/or
indirect effects are greater then other species. So, when the more centralized (foundation)
species have genetically based interactions, genetic effects will tend to be magnified in
the community. Here, we found that even though more abundant or more centralized
(i.e., “important”) species were present in the community, their effects were not the main
component responding to genetic effects. Considering the impact of network structure
would be a productive path forward for the theoretical development and application of
the IIGE concept.
Evolution and Genetically Based Network Structure
The demonstration of evolution at any scale of biological organization requires demonstrating three key elements. First, there must be variation in the structure (composition,
abundance, species interactions, diversity, networks) of communities across the landscape. Second, these differences must be genetically based and heritable in which
community structure is passed from one generation to the next. For example, numerous
studies show that related individuals tend to support the same communities of insects
and microbes, and ecosystem processes of biodiversity, nutrient cycling and stability, whereas unrelated individuals support more different communities and ecosystem
processes (Des Roches et al., 2018; Whitham et al., 2020). Importantly, the current
study shows that networks are also heritable traits that greatly increases its utility as a
community phenotype that selection can act upon. Third, selection must act on these
differences to favor some communities over others leading to change over time (i.e.,
community evolution). Since our findings show that networks are heritable, another
metric of community evolution is showing how networks change over time in response
to an invasive species, climate change, or some other agent of selection.
Intra-specific, genotypic diversity could be creating lichen metacommmunities on
individual trees that form interaction modules with different dynamics. When communities are comprised of individuals who’s habitat is primarily determined by another
organism, these communities inherently form modules within the larger ecosystem,
as they tend to interact more with each other than with other individuals (Lau et al.,
2017). Our study demonstrates that the environmental differences determined by the
genetic variation within a single species can create differences that not only impacts
community composition, as repeatedly demonstrated in other community genetics studies (Whitham et al., 2006; Des Roches et al., 2018), but also the structure of interactions
among individuals within these modules. Some network structures are likely to be more

stable, either in response to disturbance or via self-organized dynamics. For example,
centralized networks, although more efficient, are theorized to be more susceptible to
targeted attacks. As mentioned previously, one class of networks that are theorized to
have amplifying effects on networks have centralized ”star” shapes with one or a few
species at the center and radiating interactions out from the central core (Lleberman
et al., 2005). This is structurally what we have observed with the networks that tend to
occur on some of the genotypes in our study, i.e., the more centralized networks. It is
likely that these networks could function as hot-spots of evolutionary dynamics resulting
from the amplifying effect the centralized network structure found on that tree genotype,
as multiple studies have found significant impacts of the removal of foundation species
in different systems (Keith et al., 2017; Des Roches et al., 2018).
Ecological network studies have focused on asymmetry and the quantification of
its structure in communities. The impacts of asymmetry on evolution from community
dynamics have primarily produced qualitative discussion (Bascompte et al., 2006;
Dı́az-Castelazo et al., 2010; Guimarães et al., 2011; Thompson, 2013). More specific
predictions can be found in applications of evolutionary game theory, and although
developed at the population scale, such theory can apply to communities (Lieberman
et al., 2005). One seemingly useful direction is the classification of networks into
two general categories, rooted and cyclic, in which rooted networks have interactions
in which evolutionary effects emanate from one or multiple origins but these effects
do not have feedbacks to the origin, whereas cyclic networks contain feedbacks to
one or more origins. This is equivalent to “unidirectional” and “reciprocal” genetic
effects in the context of IIGE theory (Whitham et al., 2020). As we do not have an
estimate of the effect of the lichen on the fitness of the tree they occur on, we can not
determine whether the lichen networks in this system are cyclic or not. In terrestrial
ecosystems, lichen play important ecological roles, such as substrate stabilization (Root
et al., 2011) and nutrient fixation (Nelson et al., 2018). In some systems lignicolous
lichens can have demonstrable effects on the availability of nutrients for the trees that
they are associated with (Norby and Sigal, 1989), although this has not been measured
for the lichen in the current study’s system. Elucidating the presence of and quantifying
such feedbacks would allow for the determination of the cyclic nature and potential
evolutionary dynamics.
Since lichen are multi-species complexes, there is also the potential for evolutionary
dynamics to shift within the context of the lichen symbiosis. There is substantial
evidence that lichen have served as the “cradle of symbiotrophic fungal diversification”
(Arnold et al., 2009) and recent research has shown significant network structure of
endolichenic fungi and lichen collected from across North America (Chagnon et al.,
2016). Analysis of the structure of ecological networks has generally supported the
conclusion that nestedness, or the degree to which species tend to interact with similar
subsets of the community, tends to promote stability in mutualistic, primarily bipartite
(i.e., two-mode), networks and modularity contributes to the stabilization of antagonistic
networks (Elias et al., 2013; Grilli et al., 2016). Although there is growing evidence
that the nestedness of mutualistic networks is not necessarily the result of selection for
systems-level properties that promote stability but could be either product of asymptotic
abundance distributions leading to uneven interaction frequencies (Staniczenko et al.,
2013) and/or a by-product of selection and divergence creating network “spandrels” in

ecosystems (Valverde et al., 2018), this does not preclude the functional consequences
of network structure but rather the developmental or evolutionary processes that have
produced the structure. In the present study, we did not examine nestedness or modularity
of the lichen networks as we could not find metrics for analyzing networks that are
not only weighted and directed but also signed. Hopefully future network theoretic
developments will make the appropriate metrics available to conduct these analyses.
Conclusion
In the face of the high degree of complexity and potential context dependency of
ecological processes, the current study points to the utility of considering the spatial and
temporal scales of interactions, as discussed in previous studies (Bangert et al., 2006;
Zook et al., 2010; Zytynska et al., 2012). In the present research, we found that the
assembly of ecological networks can have a measurable genetic basis depending on
the spatial scale of interactions, due in part, to asymmetries in size and longevity of
organisms. The importance of the scale of network organization to create hierarchical
structure (Guimarães, 2020) and the potential for foundation species to create this
structure in the vast majority of ecosystems (Ellison et al., 2005; Whitham et al., 2006)
suggests that future work would be aided by determining these modules within the biotic
community that include species with large differences in body-size and longevity. Also,
as heritable variation is the raw material for natural selection to act upon, a genetic basis
for interaction network structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered
at the community level and that conserving genetic variation is important to consider in
efforts to restore or preserve complex species interactions and their associated ecosystem
functions (Evans et al., 2013).
One possible path forward is for future work to extend the many previous community
genetics studies that have focused on sessile organisms, such as galling insects (Bailey
et al., 2005; Whitham et al., 2006; Crutsinger et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2011; Keith
et al., 2017), to quantify the frequency of these interactions in the context of the larger
community. This would provide an estimate of the relative impact of these focal, often
termed foundation, species. In addition, community genetics theory has only quantified
first order interactions, i.e., among pairs; therefore, indirect effects from higher order
interactions are not explicitly accounted for (Shuster et al., 2006; Whitham et al., 2012,
2020). Given that network structure could be influenced by genetic effects, assessing
higher order interactions could provide a path forward for theoretical advances (e.g.,
IIGEs) that could help with identifying important characteristics of sub-groups to focus
on in empirical studies. That is, the combined interactions of communities of interacting
species should be reflected in the differences of networks of individual plant genotypes
and how they might differ across a landscape in which selection pressures change in
response to local biotic and abiotic conditions, leading to the optimization of modules
under different selective pressures. Network modeling and analysis could prove useful
for the identification of species within network modules that are most important to
study in systems where little is known about the biology of the system. For example, in
systems where background knowledge of the natural history of organisms is lacking,
network analyses based on species occurrence and abundance direct researchers to
species that could be focused on to best understand the dynamics of the system. Such
investigations will bring us closer to understanding the evolutionary drivers of Darwin’s

Figure 2. Lichen interaction networks were constructed by conducting field
observations in 1 cm2 cells within a 100 cm2 grid on each tree using a checkerboard
pattern (grey cells). Thus, a set of N total cell observations were recorded for each tree
with the presence or absence of each species recorded for each cell. Applying the
probability-based network modeling method adapted from (Araújo et al., 2011), we
calculated the conditional probabilities, P(Si |S j ), for all species pairs and removed (i.e.,
set equal to zero) species pairs whose joint probabilities, P(Si S j ), were not significant
using a confidence interval based comparison of their observed co-occurrence
frequency, Si S j , to that expected due to chance alone, E[P(Si S j )] = P(Si )P(S j ), and
P(Si |S j ) reduces to P(Si ), the observed individual probability of species Si .

Figure 3. Lichen networks varied in structure among tree genotypes. Network
diagrams of the mean lichen interaction matrices averaged for all trees and for several
individual genotypes (996, WC5 and 1008) showing a range of interaction network
structure. Directionality (arrowheads) and sign (red = negative, black = positive) of
interactions are shown as edges between species (abbreviated by the first letter of the
genus and specific epithet), which are scaled by their magnitude. The sign of the
interaction is indicative of greater (positive) or lesser (negative) paired occurrences than
expected relative to the overall frequency of occurrence of each species. Ecologically,
the links in the network are likely the product of multiple types of interactions (e.g.
mutualism, parasitism, competition, facilitation) that could vary over both space and
time.
